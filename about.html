    <h2 class="page-title">About Woodley Index</h2>
    <p>The Woodley Index purports to measure academic capability (by way of SAT Scores, and percentage of incoming students submitting test scores), selectivity (through acceptance rates), graduation rates, percentage of students not taking out student loans, and institutional wealth (through endowment per full time student). Not considered are factors related to “outcomes” (including such factors as average salary of graduates, a measure correlated with the percentage of students majoring in STEM fields), factors related to economic diversity and the performance of low-income students (such as the graduation rates of students receiving Pell Grants), and factors related to social mobility.
The Ivory & Gold Index’s methodology favors universities whose student bodies score highly on standardized tests, graduate on time, and do not take out student loans. The methodology also favors schools which accept a small percentage of applicants and have high endowment to student ratios. Also favored are schools which accept relatively few students “test-optional.” For schools with “test-free” and “test-blind” admissions processes, graduation rates substitute SAT scores in ranking calculations.
